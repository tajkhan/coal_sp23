Stored-program computer was a concept introduced by John Non Neumann who proposed to store the program instruction as binary in computer memory. This made the computer much more flexible and powerful. By being able to store the program in memory we could make the computer perform any task.  

> Earlier computers had their instructions hardwired into their physical design or held externally on punched paper tape or cards. Reprogramming them to do a different task entailed internal rewiring or altering the physical storage media.

Manchester Mark I "Baby" was the first computer to implement the stored-program concept. EDVAC followed the same year.
